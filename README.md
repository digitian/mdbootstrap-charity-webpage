# mdbootstrap-charity-webpage

I have made this project for charities. This web page represents the main page of a greater website. The page structure might give an idea for the rest. Main page contains a sticky navbar, welcome section, latest events section, comments section, gallery section, contact section and a footer section with social media buttons.

This project has been made by using Material Design Bootstrap.
